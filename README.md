# Maze Solving Program

This maze solving program consists of four main components:

1. **GenerateMaze.c**: This program generates a random maze of a specified size.

2. **dfs.c**: This program implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to solve the generated maze.

3. **bfs.c**: This program implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to solve the generated maze.

4. **Astar.c**: This program implements the A* algorithm to solve the generated maze.

## Usage

1. **GenerateMaze.c**:

   Compile and run the program to generate a maze. Specify the size of the maze as a command-line argument.

   ```bash
    make all
   ./a.out
